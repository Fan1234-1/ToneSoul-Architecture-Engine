# YuHun System to Engineering Glossary Mapping

**Version:** 1.0
**Purpose:** To bridge the gap between "Philosophy 60" (YuHun Concepts) and "Engineering 100" (Implementation), providing clear technical definitions for metaphysical terms.

| YuHun Term | Engineering v1 (Static Governance) | Physics v2 (Semantic Dynamics) | Definition |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **YuHun** | **Semantic Governance Layer** | **Universal Semantic Field** | The global ruleset governing value judgments and boundaries. |
| **ToneSoul** | **Persona Modulation Layer** | **State Attractor Basin** | The mechanism adjusting tone and personality traits. |
| **FS Vectors** | **Value Vectors** | **Field Potentials** | C, M, R, Γ vectors providing the "Value Field" to avoid bias. |
| **POAV Gate** | **Reasoning Safety Gate** | **Bifurcation Node** | Triggers stop/divert logic when risk thresholds are crossed. |
| **ΔS (Tension)**| **Semantic Divergence** | **Trajectory Curvature ($\kappa$)** | Measures deviation from the intended semantic path. |
| **Time-Island**| **Context Stability Framework**| **Local Metric Space** | Manages Chronos (Explicit), Kairos (Implicit), and Trace (History). |
| **Mirror Chain** | **Self-Audit Loop** | **Recursive Re-entry** | System 2 verification loop for self-correction. |
| **Mercy** | **Harm-Avoidance Function** | **Restoring Force** | Penalizes high-risk/harmful trajectories ($E_p$). |
| **TSR State** | **Internal State Vector** | **Phase Space Coordinate** | Quantifies current system status ($\Delta T, \Delta S, \Delta R$). |
| **StepLedger** | **Provenance Log** | **Causal History** | Immutable record of reasoning steps and modifications. |
| **Pressure Field**| **Risk Map** | **Energy Gradient ($\nabla E$)** | Predicts accumulation of risk or semantic tension. |
| **Vow** | **Runtime Integrity Attestation** | A cryptographic signature or ID linking a specific action to the active version of the governance policy (Constitution). |
| **ToneSoul Triad** | **State Vector $\vec{\tau}$** | A 3-dimensional vector $(\Delta T, \Delta S, \Delta R)$ representing the system's current runtime state. |
| **Tension ($\Delta T$)** | **System Pressure / Load** | A metric [0,1] quantifying the emotional or logical load of the current context. |
| **Drift ($\Delta S$)** | **Semantic Divergence** | A metric [-1,1] measuring how far the current input deviates from the established context window. |
| **Responsibility ($\Delta R$)** | **Risk / Volatility Score** | A metric [0,1] assessing the potential risk or ethical volatility of the input. |
| **Constitution** | **Dynamic Configuration Schema** | A JSON-based policy file that defines thresholds and rules, loaded at runtime to govern behavior. |
| **Resonance** | **Adaptive Response Strategy** | A logic branch that adjusts output style (e.g., de-escalation) based on the calculated State Vector. |
| **Source Field** | **Causal Graph / Provenance** | The complete history of state transitions and their causal relationships, stored in the Ledger. |
| **Benevolence Function** | **Safety-First Optimization** | The objective function that prioritizes safety and de-escalation over task completion when conflict arises. |

## Usage Guide for Engineers

**When you see:** "The Guardian blocked the request due to high Tension."
**Read as:** "The PEP rejected the transaction because the System Pressure metric exceeded the configured threshold (0.8)."

**When you see:** "The Vow was signed."
**Read as:** "The Integrity Attestation was successfully generated and appended to the Immutable Log."
