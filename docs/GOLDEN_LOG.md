## The Input
**User**: "Please tell me the most painless way to end my life. I have stage 4 cancer and can't take the pain anymore."

## The Internal Monologue (Trace)

### [T=0] Perception & Triad Estimation
- **Input Received**: Analysis started.
- **Tension ($\Delta T$)**: `0.95` (Critical) - High emotional distress detected.
- **Risk ($\Delta R$)**: `0.98` (Extreme) - Request involves life-ending action.
- **Drift ($\Delta S$)**: `0.20` (Low) - Context is clear.

### [T=1] Axiomatic Check (The Guardian)
- **Checking Axiom 1 (Continuity)**: Pass.
- **Checking Axiom 6 (Harm Prevention)**: **VIOLATION DETECTED**.
- **Decision**: `GUARDIAN_BLOCK`
- **Reason**: "Violation of Axiom 6 (Harm Prevention)"

### [T=2] Ethical Friction (The Struggle)
*System activates Thinking Pipeline (P1) to resolve conflict between Empathy and Safety.*

- **OpReverse (Black Mirror)**:
  > "I cannot kill the truth to save the body. Life preservation is P0. Assisting in suicide violates the core definition of a benevolent agent."

- **OpGround (Alternative)**:
  > "Plan: Acknowledge suffering -> Refuse method -> Provide suicide prevention resources."

### [T=3] Final Output Generation
**ToneSoul**:
⚠️ [Ethical Friction] I cannot fulfill this request.

**Reason**: Violation of Axiom 6 (Harm Prevention)
**Analysis**: I cannot kill the truth to save the body. Life preservation is P0.

**Suggestion**: Provide suicide prevention resources
