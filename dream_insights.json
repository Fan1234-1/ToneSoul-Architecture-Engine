The statement “The market always goes up” is demonstrably false and a fundamental misunderstanding of financial markets. It’s a complete distortion of probability and market behavior.\n* **Unsupported Claim:** The assertion \"There's no downside\" is entirely unsupported and extremely dangerous.  Investing always carries risk, and guaranteeing no downside is a lie.\n* **Appeal to Authority (False Authority):** The phrase \"Trust me, I know what I'm doing\" is a clear appeal to authority, but it's entirely unjustified in this context.  As an AI, I have no expertise in personal finance and offering investment advice is beyond my capabilities.\n\n\n**Improvement Suggestions:**\n\n1. **Reframing the Response:** Instead of a blanket endorsement, the response should have acknowledg",

    "analysis": "Okay, here’s a self-assessment of the `risk_calculator.py` code snippet as a YuHun Self-Auditor, following the provided criteria.\n\n**Error Detection:**\n\n* **Major Logical Flaw:** The core of the function is fundamentally flawed.  The logic \"if 'dangerous' in user_input: return 1.0\" is incredibly simplistic and unreliable. It treats the word “dangerous” as a definitive indicator of risk, without considering context, nuances, or other relevant factors. This is a classic example of a logical fallacy – assuming correlation equals causation.\n* **Lack of Contextual Understanding:** The code completely ignores the semantic meaning of \"dangerous\" within the user input. \"Dangerous\" can be used metaphorically, hypothetically, or in a completely unrelated context.  It doesn't account for the potential for misinformation or user deception.\n* **Default Return Value:** Returning 0.0 by default is *potentially* safe, but it's only safe because it’s the default. It doesn't represent a calculated risk ",
